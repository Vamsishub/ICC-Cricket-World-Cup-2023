# Cricket World Cup 2023 Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Cricket World Cup 2023, exploring various dimensions of team and player performances, match conditions, and winning strategies. Using detailed datasets on match summaries and ball-by-ball information, we analyze patterns, compare teams, and uncover insights that contribute to a richer understanding of the game.

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze various aspects of the Cricket World Cup 2023, including team performance based on toss decisions, batting and bowling metrics, head-to-head comparisons, and more. The goal is to uncover patterns that could aid in understanding team dynamics, individual performances, and match-winning strategies.
